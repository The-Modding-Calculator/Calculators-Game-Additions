This is a patch I made to be able to load my PAL save on US EBOOT when I accidentally repacked the wrong eboot into my iso for HW

It works by replacing the game serial strings with either the PAL or US serial depending which patch is active

I tried to use this on HW but it crashed on boot. There are two possable reasons for this either address was the wrong size or prehaps CWCheat just loads the patch at a very bad time. Either way I recomend just using on emulator for now to load your save then change the region and save now you can transfer your save to HW and enjoy : )

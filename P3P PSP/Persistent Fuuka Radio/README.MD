This is a patch that actually affects gameplay without the use of any other mods!
It simply leaves the Fuuka BGM playing though battle and post battle

As a side affect I had to prevent the game from muting BGM at the begining and post battle. I can't be 100% sure this won't stop the BGM from muting at other times as well so if you notice this happening anywhere please let me know.

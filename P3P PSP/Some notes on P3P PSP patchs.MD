The .ini files are for use on emulator

The cheats.db files are for use on hardware (HW) with the CWCheat plugin

PAL and US copies of the P3P EBOOT are almost identical. All the function addresses I've encoutered so far have been the same and all the patchs I've made so far have been tested on both PAL and US copies.
For all the patchs in here I've used the US serial (ULUS10512) since that's what most pepole will be using but if you wish to use my patches on a PAL copy you can just change the serials used in the ini names and inside the cheats.db to the PAL one (ULES01523).

If your using multipul patches just copy paste them all into one file, if your using the CWCheat versions make sure you don't have the game serial listed twice in your cheat.db.
I've inclided a dummey serial at the begining of each cheats.db becase I couldn't get it to list the cheats without atleast two serials in the file.

The GB version will have all the patchs combinded into a single file for ease of use, but here I've left them sperate for better orginsation.

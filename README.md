# Calculators-Game-Additions
 This is a Git-Hub Repo that contains patches I make for diffrent games...
 Well mostly Persona games but who who knows what I'll do in the future
 Some of these patchs will change the gameplay bythems selfs -eg. Persistent Fuuka Radio- others will require other mods for there to be any noticable diffrence -eg. Unhardcoded BGM-

While I'm here I would like to give my deepest thanks to Tupelov for not only inspiring me, but also teaching me and helping me get my foot of the ground with mips assembly which made these patches possible
